title: Read Data From Files
---
There must be occasions when you have to read data from files. Sometimes things get annoying when you just want a certain specific data in a messy file. Here are some useful notes I want to *keep and share*, after get really annoyed by the above situation.

1. You can always use well-designed software like Excel.

In this way, you can use your mouse and click here and there, solving your problem.

2. You can use Python.

In this way, an important package you need to know is **re** -- [Regular expression operations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html). 

3. While, for now I think i am going to stick with Method 2, until I get enough practise. I think **Numpy.loadtxt()** is also very handy, and I believe it is a basic skill in **Data Science**. One need to keep practising so that you can freely play with all these methods.

Anyway, you can always find more useful and detailed answers on Google, don't hesitate to search for answers when you encounter one problem. That's the spirit. 

However, don't wander too far with all those fancy answers -- it is solving the problem that is your ultimate goal! 

Use the one that you are already familiar with, or find the best method to startover? That's the question.
